## Introduction

### Background
Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) [estimates](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cancer) that cancer was responsible for 9.6 million deaths globally in 2018. Globally, about 1 in 6 deaths is due to cancer. 
Studies consistently [show](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/03-02-2017-early-cancer-diagnosis-saves-lives-cuts-treatment-costs) that early cancer diagnosis saves lives and cuts treatment costs . 

I wanted to be a part of the solution in helping people detect cancer early. So I decided to build a skin cancer recognition model using 23.9K images from the [International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)](https://www.isic-archive.com/#!/topWithHeader/onlyHeaderTop/gallery). The images were all moles in the skin that were labeled either melanoma or not. 


### AWS Setup
Since I was dealing with large sets of image data, I decided to set up AWS EC2 instances to process and store the images. I decided to set up 2 [t3.2xlarge](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/t3/) server instances with 150 GB of storage. One instance was for building the neural network pipeline and another was for training the pipeline on the image dataset. By having 2 server instances, I could build and run the pipeline simultaneously. 

### Data

#### Web scrapping
I’ve scraped the 23.K images from the [ISIC](https://www.isic-archive.com/#!/topWithHeader/onlyHeaderTop/gallery) website. You can find the code I used for web scrapping [here](0.&#32;Data&#32;extraction&#32;and&#32;cleaning.ipynb).  

After scrapping the images, I ended up having 53 GB worth of images with a [metadata](data/metadata.csv) that had the labeled information. With my AWS setup, it took about 2 hours to download all the images.

#### Data Cleaning
The images had inconsistent sizes so I resized them all to 100 x 100 pixel dimensions. 

There were 249 images (roughly 1% of the entire dataset) that didn’t have labels to indicate if the patient had cancer or not.  So I decided to drop those images and ended up with a total of 23,653 images. 

I split my training and test set with a 80:20 split and ended up with the below ratio.

- **Train Set: 18,922 images**
- **Test Set: 4,731 images**

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Sample images
Here are a few samples of cancerous and non-cancerous mole images after resizing. As you can see, it is difficult to distinguish cancerous moles from a human eye.

### Imbalanced Data
I quickly realized that my dataset was imbalanced. Roughly 91% were non-cancerous and only 9% were cancerous. This imbalance makes sense because only a small proportion of the population have cancer at a given time. 


![Imbalanced Data](Images/unbalanced.png)

To work with these imbalanced datasets, I decided to adjust the `class_weights` parameter in the `fit` method in `keras`. If I didn’t have enough images, I may have considered oversampling the minority class by augmenting the images in `keras`.

## Pipeline

My objective of this project was to have a [recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall) higher than 95% and optimize the [F1 score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score) as much as possible. The cost of false negatives  (predicted non-cancerous, but was actually cancerous) were extremely high so I wanted to stick with a model to keep a high recall rate over [precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall). 

Below is the [confusion matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix) for reference.

![Confusion Matrix](Images/confusion_matrix.png)

### Base Model

I started off my project with a baseline model so I would have something to compare to. I used a simple method that would randomly classify images with the same ratio of non-cancerous (90.8%) and cancerous (9.2%). 

With this randomized model, I got a **recall 8.3%,  precision 8.6%, and a F1 score 8.4%**. The below confusion matrix was the predicted total counts.

![Base Model Confusion Matrix](Images/base_model_cm.png)

This random model was missing most of the cancerous images and fell extremely short of the desired 95% recall rate. This result wasn’t surprising because it was randomly predicted in an imbalanced dataset. 

### Transfer Learning

After numerous repetition on building/editing my convolutional neural network, I ended up  
incorporating transfer learning using [VGG16](https://keras.io/api/applications/vgg/#vgg16-function).  I removed the last convolution and dense layers with my model with a `sigmoid` activation. You can view the code [here](1.&#32;Modeling.ipynb) for details. 

Here are the accuracy and loss score after each epoch. With my current AWS instance, each epoch took me about 10 minutes so with 20 epochs, it took me about 3 hours in total. 

I was able to observe that the accuracy and loss were pretty stagnant after 20 epochs. Therefore, I decided that there were no need for additional epochs considering the computational costs.

## Model Evaluation

### ROC AUC Curve
My transfer learning model got an area under the curve (AUC) score of **0.886**. This indicates that my model is overall performing well in distinguishing the correct classes.  

![ROC AUC](Images/roc_auc.png)

### Precision-Recall Curve
The graph below is my model’s Precision-Recall Curve.  The area highlighted in red are all recalls >= 95%. As mentioned earlier, I’m building a model that has a recall of 95% or higher. Given that recall >= 95% threshold mark, the most liberal threshold I have for my model is **0.17948207**. 


![Precision-Recall Curve](Images/pr_curve.png)

### F1 Score
In order to confirm I was choosing the best threshold, I plotted all of the F1 scores. The area highlighted in red are all recalls >= 95%. Once my recall was above 95%, I wanted to choose a threshold that gave me the highest F1 score to keep balance of the image classification. The location on the orange star gave me the highest F1 score given that recall >= 95% with a threshold of **0.17885771**. 

![F1 Scores](Images/f1.png)


### Confusion Matrix
Using my final threshold of **0.17885771**, I’ve got my results as shown below. 


![Final CNN](Images/final_CNN.png)


| Metric     | Score |
| ---------- | ----- |
| Recall     | 0.954 |
| Precision  | 0.217 |
| F1 Score   | 0.352 |
| Accuracy   | 0.679 |


### Application

I believe my model can coexist in the current medical industry. This model can be incorporated in an app where customers can upload pictures of their moles and to check their probability of being cancerous or not.  The model will have 2 separate ways of approaching the predicted classification. 

First, if the model predicts the mole negatively, it's most like non-cancerous. With this first step, I’m able to classify roughly 60% of the people that most likely don’t have cancer. The caveat is that there is still a 0.7% chance that it can be cancerous so it wouldn’t be definitive. 

Second, if the model predicts positively, I would first inform the user not to panic because roughly 78% of the time, it’s a false positive. However, on the flip side, there is a roughly 22% chance it could be cancerous. I would recommend the user to go through checkups so that in the case it is cancerous, it can be detected early. 

Overall this model can help people detect cancer at an early stage and ultimately increase survival rate. However, since most people don’t have cancer, 31.7% of the people will have false positives and it may cause panic to some people. So explaining the characteristics about this model will be very important.

## Future works

### Possible ways to improve pipeline
Some possible ways to improve this model would be to use bigger pixel sizes for each image (currently at 100x100), use oversampling methods such as image augmentation, incorporate more metadata features (Eg. age, gender, etc.), and invest more time in tuning the convolutional neural network (CNN) (Eg. adjust parameters, increase layers, increase epochs, etc.). All of these will involve creating AWS with better specs which can be costly. 

### Build App
In the future, I can try building an app. The users can upload photos of their moles and it would return a `positive` or `negative` of it being cancerous. I would include the explanation of the classification as mentioned earlier.
